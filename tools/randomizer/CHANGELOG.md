# Changelog

## v0.2.0 (2026-03-15) — Major Update

### Critical Bug Fix
- **Config values are now 64-bit doubles** — Previous versions read/wrote 32-bit floats at the wrong offset, producing incorrect values and corrupting data on write. All config patching now uses correct 8-byte IEEE 754 doubles. Example corrections: initial_fuel was 2.5, actually 8.0; fuel_inc_gems was 3.25, actually 100.

### New Features

#### Randomizer
- **Level connection randomization** — Shuffles exits between levels within path-length groups. Clears start spots for safe spawning at level origin. Disabled by default (may cause unsolvable seeds).
- **Custom item pool** — Choose exactly how many of each power and fragment to include in the randomization pool via GUI spinboxes or `--item-pool` CLI flag.
- **Custom gem weights** — Set relative weights for diamond, emerald, sapphire, ruby, and obsidian gem distribution. Higher weight = more frequent.
- **Obsidian lock cost** — Customize the obsidian cost per temple lock (default 10, locks at 10/20/30.../100). GUI spinbox or `--obsidian-cost` CLI flag.
- **Obsidians included in gem shuffle** — Previously excluded, obsidians now randomize with other gems. Total shuffled: 97 gems across 20 levels.
- **Force build on unsolvable seeds** — When the solver can't find a completable placement, the GUI offers "Build Anyway" instead of just failing.
- **Player character swap** — Experimental: replace the player model with any character (e.g., `--player-character evil_noreht`). Animations may not match. Max 11 characters.

#### Entity Editor (New Tab)
- **8 editable sections** with 8,466+ patchable values:
  - Entity Stats — walkSpeed, runSpeed, attackRange, HP, knockback per entity (108 entities)
  - Entity Damage Multipliers — 62 damage type vulnerability multipliers per entity (107 entities)
  - Damage Types — Base damage, cost, delay, freeze for all 57 attack types (player + enemy)
  - Player Global Settings — Flat list: initial HP (200), max HP (400), fuel per upgrade, gems needed (100), fall damage thresholds
  - Armor Properties — All 19 armor types × 3 tiers: protection, HP, cost, hits, time, flaps
  - Critters Movement & AI — Provoke distance, stalk, flee, turn rate per enemy
  - Critters Flocking — Boids parameters
  - Enemy Damage Overrides — Per-enemy damage values
- **Randomize stats** — Set min/max percentage range, randomize single entity or entire section
- **Load from ISO** — Read current default values from the game ISO for reference
- **Export Mod JSON** — Save edits as a mod file for manual application
- **Auto-integration** — Entity editor edits automatically included when building randomized ISO

#### QoL Patches
- **Fist pump animation disabled** — Found and patched the real animation trigger in the player state machine (0x2B0F2), not just the one-time notification
- **Three QoL patches now**: gem first-pickup popups (5), obsidian first-pickup notification, per-pickup fist pump animation

#### GUI Improvements
- Warning labels on Keys, Barriers, and Connections checkboxes ("may cause unsolvable seeds")
- Config Editor tab shows "Work in Progress" banner
- Entity Editor scroll only when content overflows
- Window size increased to accommodate new controls

### Bug Fixes
- **Missing entity scanner fix** — Added all power and fragment names to DIRECT_SEARCH_NAMES fallback list. Fixed 3 entities (f4/frag_fire_2, w2/power_water, a5/power_air) that were missed by the standard 1.0f marker scanner, causing item duplication.
- **Config editor "Section '_meta' not found"** — Backend now correctly reads sections from `data["sections"]` instead of top-level keys.
- **xdvdfs Windows path fix** — Uses POSIX forward slashes for in-image paths, fixing "Entry does not exist" errors when GUI runs from native Windows (not Git Bash).
- **Town barrier item scaling** — Non-native items placed behind obsidian barriers are scaled to 0.5x to prevent protruding through force fields.

### Engine Research (for developers)
- 39 registered node types fully decoded with handler addresses
- Node graph connection format decoded (12-byte triplets in NDBG)
- Complete damage system: 56 damage types, vulnerability matrix, armor system
- AI pathfinding: no navmesh, direct-to-target + Boids flocking
- Level loading: full teardown/load pipeline, start spot resolution
- Save system: 3-tier persistence, randomizer confirmed save-safe
- Collection fourcc from critters_engine config table (name-driven)
- Cross-type spawning confirmed (enemies at item locations and vice versa)
- Ghidra structures header (azurik_structures.h) with 26 structs and 12 enums

- Full-game randomizer with forward-fill logic solver
- Major items, keys, gems, barriers randomization
- Seed-based reproducibility
- GUI with category checkboxes
- QoL patches: gem popups, obsidian animation
